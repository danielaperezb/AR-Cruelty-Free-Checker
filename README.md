# 🐰 AR Cruelty-Free Checker: Enhancing Ethical Shopping through Augmented Reality

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project is a **Design Case Study** exploring how **Augmented Reality (AR)** can simplify and accelerate ethical decision-making during the shopping process. 

The primary goal was to design and prototype an AR application that allows users to instantly **scan product packaging** and receive clear, actionable information regarding its cruelty-free status.

## 💡 Key UX & Interaction Design Challenges

1.  **Seamless Integration:** Designing an AR overlay that provides critical data (cruelty-free status, certifications) without obstructing the user's view of the physical product or surrounding environment.
2.  **Information Hierarchy:** Structuring complex, third-party data (cruelty-free lists) into a simple, high-impact **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** suitable for quick viewing.
3.  **Visual Feedback:** Implementing clear visual cues (e.g., green checkmarks vs. red warnings) to immediately communicate the ethical status.
