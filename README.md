# 🐰 AR Cruelty-Free Checker: Enhancing Ethical Shopping through Augmented Reality

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project is a **Design Case Study** that explores how Augmented Reality (AR) can simplify and accelerate ethical decision-making during the shopping experience.

The objective was to design and prototype an AR application that enables users to **scan product packaging** and instantly receive clear, actionable information about its cruelty-free status.

## 💡 Key UX & Interaction Design Challenges

1.  **Seamless Integration:** Designing an AR overlay that delivers essential information (certifications, cruelty-free verification) without obstructing the user’s view of the physical product or environment.
2.  **Information Hierarchy:** Transforming complex third-party data (cruelty-free lists) into a simple, high-impact **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** suitable for quick viewing.
3.  **Visual Feedback:** Creating intuitive visual cues—such as green approvals or red alerts—to communicate ethical status at a glance and reduce cognitive load.

## ⚠️ Current Scope Limitation

The live demo currently recognizes and displays data for only three brands: **Garnier, Nivea, and Jean&Len**. The next development phase will focus on integrating a comprehensive third-party API to expand the database and support a broader range of products.
